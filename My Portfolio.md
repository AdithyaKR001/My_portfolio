# <div style="text-align: center;"> My Portfolio </div>

## **1. Introduction:**
I am a software developer, based out of Bangalore, India, with more than 13 years of experience in designing and developing software features and products that meet or exceed customer expectations.


I am currently developing AI/ML solutions to help customers with their business requirements, with a key focus on natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, computer vision, and linear and logistic regression.

I hold a post-graduate Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML and AI) from Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU), United Kingdom and a graduate engineering degree, B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering, from Anna University, Chennai, India.

My key skills include:
* Python
* Java
* Natural Language Processing.
* Deep Learning.

## **2. My projects:**

### **a. Natural Language Processing:**

#### **i.	Emotion and Personality Trait Detection from social media text:**

* Development of a hybrid deep-learning classification model to address existing research gaps and build a better classifier to determine the personality trait or emotion being conveyed by input lines of text gathered from social media.

* Programming language used: Python.

* Python libraries used: NLTK, Keras, Gensim (FastText, Word2Vec), GloVe, Sklearn etc.

* Datasets used:
    * MBTI
    * TEC
    * ISEAR

* Processing steps:
    * Data pre-processing steps (text cleanup, lemmatization, word tokenization etc).
    * Data splitting (train-validation-test split).
    * Text tokenization.
    * Label encoding.
    * Class imbalance handling.
    * Word embedding (FastText, GloVe,  Word2Vec).
    * CNN layers.
    * Bi-directional LSTM (or) Bi-directional GRU layer.
    * Classification layer (softmax).
    * Model performance evaluation (precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, AUROC).


#### **ii.	Automatic Ticket Classification for a Banking Solution:**

* Development and evaluation of classifier models, to classify customer complaints based on the products (or) services, by first using NLP techniques such as topic modelling and NMF, to identify the topics (or) classes to segregate the data based on, and then building multiple supervised ML classifiers model using the same, and finally identifying the best performing classifier.
  
* Programming language used: Python.
  
* Python libraries used: Sklearn, Pandas, Wordcloud, Pandas etc.

* Dataset used: dataset of complaints received by banking customers.
  
* Processing steps:
    * Data loading and text pre-processing.
    * Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    * Feature extraction and topic modelling.
    * Model building (supervised), training and evaluation.
    * Model inference.
